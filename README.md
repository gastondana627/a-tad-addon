## 🚀 Project Timeline

### ✅ **July 16, 2025**
- Initialized Vite + React project for frontend.
- Created basic folder structure for backend and frontend.
- Defined `/api/process-url` endpoint in `Flask app.py`.

### ✅ **July 17, 2025**
- Installed Flask and tested locally using Postman.
- Validated `requirements.txt` to ensure compatibility with deployment.
- Added custom `Content-Type` header handling in `Flask` endpoint.
- Cleaned up manifest errors in Chrome extension via `ccweb-add-on-scripts`.

### ✅ **July 18, 2025**
- Integrated full local testing:
  - `Terminal 1`: `python3 app.py` for Flask server.
  - `Terminal 2`: `npm run dev` for Vite frontend.
  - `Terminal 3`: `curl` test to `/api/process-url`.
- Used mock NBA roster URLs for API testing.

### ✅ **July 19, 2025**
- Cleaned repo using `.gitignore` to remove `cert.pem` and `key.pem`.

## 🧪 How to Run Locally

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/a-tad-addon.git
cd a-tad-addon

2. Install backend dependencies

cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run Flask backend

python3 app.py

4. Install frontend dependencies

cd ../frontend
npm install

5. Start Vite frontend

npm run dev

6. Test API using curl (in Terminal 3)

curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/process-url \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"url": "https://some-nba-roster-page.com"}'

🌐 Deployment Notes

We are exploring:
	•	✅ Render (free tier supported)
	•	❌ Railway (free tier limitations)
	•	❌ Fly.io (more complex for beginners)

Render is preferred for quick deployment of both frontend and backend.

⸻

🔒 Security
	•	cert.pem and key.pem are excluded from version control.
	•	Use .env and Flask CORS settings for secure origin control.

⸻

📌 To-Do (Future Scope)
	•	NLP annotation display in frontend.
	•	Support file uploads + screenshots.
	•	Add teacher/student login roles.
	•	Log analysis sessions for future insights.
	•	Deploy frontend and backend as a unified Render project.
